              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">Kinshasa doesn't make it to anyone's top travel destinations. For someone like me, with family connections, it's a place I've always thought about, heard about, and wanted to experience. I consider it an immense privilege to have been to a place where the homogenizing effects of the West are slow to come and slow to stick.</p>
<p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">As I reflect back on my two trips to La Belle Kin, I am struck by the ability to get on with things. Good or bad, I just get on. I went to Kinshasa by myself first in 2011 and again with my papa in 2014. Both of these trips were planned so that I could meet again my father's side of the family, mainly my grandmother Caroline; but, what I remember most about these trips are my father, how he was and how he is. On that first trip, I saw how his features were reflected more or less in his brothers. I also felt my own lack in confidence more profoundly, too timid to ask for space from my little cousins, whose awareness of my every move and doting was too much, too intense. On a phone call, I remember lamenting to him how odd all of this attention felt, he simply laughed and very reasonably told me to relax, "They're just happy to be with you." I was bored toward the end of the month, longing to get out, to move into a quiet space with my thoughts.</p>
<p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">The second time around, I was struck by the calm, jedi-like spirit that inhabits my father. By this time, his dad and mum where already gone. He comes back to the house, to the neighbourhood he grew up in without the two people he loves the most. Characteristically, he tells me stories as he stares into the distant, "It wasn't like this when we were young," he says as we walk slowly.</p>
<p class="sans-light">So much has changed, the Kinshasa that I know is remarkably different from the one that he grew up in. To me, it's exciting and wholly frustrating. I just want it to be more. To live up to its potential.</p></div>
