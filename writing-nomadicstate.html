              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">Wearing my favourite beret from Marseille on a warm winter day, I went to see Black Panther and I was excited. The kind of excitement that's hard to contain. It was an utterly affecting film and I was emotional. This experience was so different, it added a clarity to my life that I didn't fathom could be filled.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">More and more, I am seeing things a lot more clearer. Less nebulous. As the the picture of my Life comes into focus, I discover my Self. I understand myself better. Everything within me changes and I reflect on moments that have helped me see my self little bit more clearly.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">During the summer of my sixteenth birthday, I spent my two-and-a-half  month summer holiday in Paris. Yet, I don't have any lasting memories of those months. I can only remember celebrating my birthday with a dinner at home and feeling so special. I can't remember feeling exceptionally happy otherwise, so much of the day-to-day was safe, predictable, and not where I wanted to be. I didn't know where I wanted to be.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">On a cloudy, late August, driving back to our small house from the airport my heart was racing. Someone we knew had passed away. Breathing heavily, I looked around my room where nothing had changed since I left but everything had changed.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">Less than two weeks later, we were all back at school, excited by the stories of Paris I could share and a new boy. He too has passed now. I often think I'll run into him as I turn a corner, just like we did in school between classes. Those tiny moments thrilled me to no end.</p>
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">This was also the first year I took my very first philosophy class. We started our first lesson debating the, “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?" I didn't know how transformative philosophy could be. It was only the beginning yet everything had changed.
              <p class="sans-light space-after-1-2">When I went to Kinshasa with my papa, hands behind his back during our long walks, he would tell me ever so peacefully of his memories of this street, that person and this or that tree. Gosh, I envied him. He has a place that is uniquely interwoven into his whole. Each one recognizing the other. While I am wobbly, searching for a connection with a place. Black Panther was such an intimate experience for me for that reason. It showed me of how lucky I am, split between memories of Bujumbura, Kigali, Kinshasa and Dar es Salaam. I belong to Africa and it belongs to me. While I will always feel like a transient, nomadic thing, I still have this whole continent that recognizes me and I in turn, recognize it.</p>
